This folder contains two text files of Shakespeare's work obtained from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/):

* [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100)
* [Macbeth](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1533)

The beginning and ending parts of the files containing copyright and license information have been removed for the text analysis exercise in "04-macbeththe.ipynb", but the full copy of the text files obtained from Project Gutenberg are available under the "data" folder.
